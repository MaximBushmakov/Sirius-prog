To use this code you should create new file with input data and run from_file([input file path], [output file path]).
In file with input there are 3 commands: 'alphabet', 'scheme' and 'tests'.
Command 'alphabet' shows that after it there is 1 line with symbols without whitespaces and dots (it`s alphabet).
Command 'scheme' shows that after it there are some lines with substitutions, any of which has 2 words, splitted by whitespace, and before 2nd there may be dot, what shows that it is final substitution.
Command 'tests' shows that after it there are some lines with words, from which algorithm will run. Results will be written into file with path [output file path] or with path './ouput.txt' if it wasn`t destignate.
